IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

Introduction

In this capstone project, our objective is to forecast the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its platform, pricing them at 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers whose costs exceed 165 million dollars each, largely attributable to SpaceX's ability to recycle the first stage. Hence, determining the first stage's landing outcome allows for the estimation of launch costs, which can be leveraged by competing firms bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.

This capstone project course offers a glimpse into the real-world challenges encountered by data scientists when handling authentic datasets. Participants will assume the role of a Data Scientist employed by a startup aiming to rival SpaceX. Throughout the process, they will follow the Data Science methodology, encompassing data acquisition, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model construction, model evaluation, and the dissemination of findings to stakeholders. The primary objective is to predict the success of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing.
